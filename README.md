# Just another wayland compositor

"Some times I get too caught up in what I could that I don't stop and think if I should"

Small experiment, trying to get a wayland compositor up and running.


Used lots of good tutorials:

* https://drewdevault.com/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html

* https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/ae4d1cdcca97ffeb2c35f0878d75dc17

* https://people.freedesktop.org/%7Ewhot/wayland-doxygen/wayland/Server/structwl__listener.html


Super cred to Drew DeVault for Wlroots and Sway!
